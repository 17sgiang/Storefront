## Searching for Deals on Electronics

The purpose of this program is to detect deals on electronics within a certain proximity given a location and radius.
The user provides a location via latitude & longitude, along with a radius in miles. Storefront then takes these parameters and finds deals on electronics within the radius of the location.

## Teamwork

Each group member was assigned different tasks that eventually tied together to establish a final product. For the entirety of the 24 hour Hackathon, we stayed in close contact with each other despite being fully virtual.
